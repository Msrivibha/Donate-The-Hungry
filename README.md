# Donate-The-Hungry
 “DONATE THE HUNGRY” is a web application which solves the major problem,
excessive food in the events, canteens and hotels this can be undone by sharing with the
orphanage people. Users those who want to give remaining food in the parties/events they must
fill the FOOD DONATION FORM by locating their address and mentioning food available
for how many people. Users who are interested to help orphans can donate money through
PhonePe and Google Pay.
 This application displays all the orphanages list in the Mahaboobnagar and gives a
privilege to celebrate any event among orphanages by pre-booking date and orphanage-name.
Users can also be a part of our website by registering as a volunteer, who collects food from
events and handovers to the orphanages. Admin will send mail to the volunteer by informing all
the details. At present we have included only the orphanages present in the Mahaboobnagar town.
